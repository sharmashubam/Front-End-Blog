# Notes App - Readme

Welcome to the Notes App project, a web-based application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) stack. This application allows you to create, read, update, and delete notes easily and efficiently. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need to have the following installed on your local machine:
- Node.js
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal:

git clone https://github.com/sharmashubam/Front-End-Blog.git


This will start the development server and you can access the application in your browser by visiting `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Front-end

The front-end of the application is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It features a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and provides a seamless user experience.

## Backend (to be updated soon)

The backend of the application is built using Express, a Node.js framework for building web applications. It connects to a MongoDB database to store and retrieve data. The backend will be updated soon with the necessary functionality to support the front-end.
